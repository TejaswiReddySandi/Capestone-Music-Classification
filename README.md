# Capestone-Music-Genre-Prediction
This project aims to classify the music genre based on various features like acousticness, speechiness, loudness etc.

# Problem Statement:
Create a machine learning model for a music aggregator application which aims to bestow the model with the capability to accurately predict the genre of songs encompassed within the dataset. With an ever expanding repository of musical compositions, the model's prowess in genre prediction is poised to shape the future of music curation.

# Dataset:
The challenge dataset, meticulously curated, serves as the cornerstone of this expedition. This rich dataset encompasses a diverse array of musical compositions, each encapsulating its genre and inherent attributes. Aspiring participants are invited to tap into this treasure trove to forge a model that harmoniously melds machine learning algorithms and musical nuances.

# Dataset Overview:
Training Dataset:
The training dataset comprises 17,996 rows, each housing 17 essential columns. These columns encompass key details such as artist name, track name, popularity, danceability, energy, key, loudness, mode, speechiness, acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness, valence, tempo, duration in milliseconds, and time_signature.

Target Variable:
The crux of the predictive endeavor revolves around the 'Class' variable. This categorical variable encompasses a diverse spectrum of musical genres including Rock, Indie, Alternative, Pop, Metal, HipHop, Alternative Music, Blues, Acoustic/Folk, Instrumental, Country, and even Bollywood.

Test Dataset:
The test dataset constitutes 7,713 rows, featuring 16 columns that mirror the information present in the training dataset. This comprehensive dataset serves as the canvas upon which the symphony of machine learning will be composed, harmonizing variables and genres to craft predictive models with a touch of data-driven artistry.
